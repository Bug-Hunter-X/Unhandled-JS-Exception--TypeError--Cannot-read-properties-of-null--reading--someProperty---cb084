This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, resulting in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'someProperty')` exception. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, uses optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??)
